   - Added Automatic Employee PIN and PIN Lock features to the Devices page  
       - *Automatic Employee PIN* - Configures a device to automatically enter an employee's PIN when Labor Sync is run.  This feature allows employees to skip the PIN entry screen when using the Labor Sync mobile app.   
       - *PIN Lock* - Limits a device to be used by only one employee.  When this setting is enabled, the only employee who can use the Labor Sync software on the device is the employee selected for Automatic Employee PIN.

   - Devices page now properly indicates if a device was never used to perform an entry.
