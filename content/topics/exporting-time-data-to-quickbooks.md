1. Make sure you have already [Synchronized with QuickBooks](%base_url%/topics/using-the-quickbooks-web-connector) and [Linked Employees and Jobs with QuickBooks](%base_url%/topics/linking-and-importing-quickbooks-items).

2. Navigate to a report with time data you would like to export.  For help building reports, see [Custom Reports](%base_url%/topics/custom-reports).

3. Once your report is ready, click on **Export to QuickBooks** near the reports options.  

4. Prepare your report for export. 
    - Time data may be altered before exporting.  Clicking on the pencil allows you to edit an entry for exporting.  Clicking on the **Red 'X'** will exclude the entry altogether.  
    - Time data being is exported for an employee as a duration. Durations may be changed before exporting, and entire entries even excluded from the export if desired. 
    - Payroll Wage Items are optional unless an employee uses time data for paychecks.  
    - Customers and Service Items are optional unless the time being exported is marked billable.  
    - While jobs are linked to customers and Payroll Wage items linked to employees, these may be changed for each entry before exporting.  
    - **No changes on this screen are saved within Labor Sync, they are only exported to QuickBooks.**

Once the Export report reflects what you would like exported, click **Export to QuickBooks** at the bottom of the page.  Items to be exported can be viewed in the *Queued Changes* section and removed prior to synchronization.  To complete the export, you must synchronize using the QuickBooks Web Connector.
