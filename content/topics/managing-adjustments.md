Adjustments are changes to the time total of an employee's work period.  Adjustments do not change the recorded time of an action, but the calculated time between actions. Any entry can be adjusted as long as that entry is not a clock out and it is followed by another entry.  In order to make an adjustment, a user must have permission to make an adjustment.
