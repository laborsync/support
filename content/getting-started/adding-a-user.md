A user is an administrative person with access to the Labor Sync system.  

1. Log in to the Labor Sync [website](https://app.laborsync.com/login).  

3. Click on the **Users** Tab near the top left of the page.  

4. Click the **Add User** button.  

5. Enter the User's information:  
    - First and Last name are not unique and are used to refer to a person within the Labor Sync system. 
    - Email address is used to identify each user.  Activation and Password reset requests are sent to the email address on file for a user.  Users will use their email address to log in, therefore each user must have their own unique email address.  
    - Time zone should reflect the time zone where the user is based.  All times displayed within reports are shown in the user's selected time zone.
    - User Permissions define what a user is allowed to do within the Labor Sync system. At least one permission must be set for a user.  
    - Display Options allow you to configure the way time is displayed for the user in reports.    
    - User Notes provides an optional field for entering any additional information.  

6. Click **Add User**.

Once a user is added, an activation email will be sent to the entered email address.  Following the link provided in the email will prompt the user to enter a password.  After the password has been entered, a user may log in using their email address and password.
