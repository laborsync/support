Jobs are used to categorize the work an employee is performing while on the clock.  Using jobs to distinguish employee time is not necessary, but an optional feature of Labor Sync.  

1. Log in to the Labor Sync [website](https://app.laborsync.com/login).  

3. Click on the **Jobs** Tab near the top left of the page.  

4. Click the **Add Job** button.  

5. Enter the Job's information:  
    - Job Name is how employees identify the job while performing actions on their mobile devices.  This is searchable from within the Labor Sync app on mobile devices.  
    - Job Reference is an optional field for an additional name or number. This is searchable from within the Labor Sync app on mobile devices.  
    - Automatic Clock Out allows job specific automated clock out of employees. This option must be enabled under account settings.  You may read more about Automatic Clock-Out in our [knowledge base article](%base_url%/topics/automatic-clock-out).  
   - Job Notes provides an optional field for entering any additional information. You may choose to show this note as a popup to employees who select this job to provide them additional information in the field.   

6. Click **Add Job**.
