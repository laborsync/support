An employee is a person being tracked by Labor Sync.  Employees use devices to update the Labor Sync system with their current activity and location.  

1. Log in to the Labor Sync [website](https://app.laborsync.com/login).  

2. Click on the **Employees** Tab near the top left of the page.  

3. Click the **Add Employee** button.  

4. Enter the Employee's information:  
    - First and Last name are not unique and are used to refer to a person within the Labor Sync system.  
    - Email and Phone are optional information. These fields are strictly informational and do not affect the functions or performance of the system.  
    - Employee PIN is a six digit number unique to each employee which is used to log in on a mobile device.  You may generate a new, unique PIN by pressing **Generate PIN**, or you may enter a PIN of your choosing.  
    - Time Zone should reflect the time zone where the employee is operating.  
    - Automatic Clock Out allows a personal automated clock out setting for each employee. This option must be enabled under account settings.  You may read more about Automatic Clock-Out in our [knowledge base article](%base_url%/topics/automatic-clock-out).  
    - Employee Notes provides an optional field for entering any additional information.  
    - Permissions can be granted to each employee to allow additional actions on the device:  
       - Add a job to your account using the mobile app.  
       - Employee crew - An employee may perform entries for other employees.  The employees for which entries can be made are managed by clicking the **Select Employee's Crew** button that appears when the option is selected, then checking off employees.  
5. Click **Add Employee**.
